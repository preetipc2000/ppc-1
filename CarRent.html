    A car is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. 
    Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one-to-eight people, have four wheels and mainly transport people rather than goods. 
    Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them.

                    <pre-1>This type of car is a small car with a rear door which opens upwards revealing the boot space to keep your luggage. 
                    Excluding the rear door, hatchbacks are built with four-doors, 
                    while two-door hatchbacks are also available in the market. 
                    Most hatchbacks use the front-wheel drivetrain to propel the vehicle, 
                    while performance-oriented hatchbacks can be either a rear-wheel or front-wheel drive. 
                    Below are some of the best hatchbacks in India.</pre-1>

                     <pre-1>The main feature of a sedan is that it is designed with separate passenger and boot space. 
                     Sedans feature four-doors and a boot or trunk. 
                     A sedan is designed as a 3-box configuration vehicle â€” engine, passenger and cargo. 
                     The word sedan is used in American English, while the word saloon is used in British English.
                     As for notchbacks, these are sedans with a less pronounced boot or trunk space. 
                     They are sedans with a hatchback rear. Apart from notchbacks, sedans can be further sub-categorised as fastback, compact or subcompact. 
                     Below are some of the best sedans in India.</pre-1>

                     <pre-1>A coupe is a two-door car with a sloping roofline, giving it a sporty stance. 
                            Most of these coupes come with a powerful engine and feature two-seats or come with smaller rear seats. 
                            However, in recent times, coupes are designed with four-doors while its characteristics remain sporty in nature.
                            While this type of car is not the preferred choice by the masses in India, 
                            there are global manufacturers selling this type of cars in India for a small category of drivers.
